``` r
library(downloader)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleControlsPopulation.csv" 
filename <- "femaleControlsPopulation.csv" 
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename) 
set.seed(1)
population = unlist( read.csv("femaleControlsPopulation.csv") )
```

To give an example of how we can simulate V and S we constructed a simulation with:

``` r
alpha <- 0.05
N <- 12
m <- 10000
p0 <- 0.90
m0 <- m*p0
m1 <- m-m0
nullHypothesis <- c(rep(TRUE,m0),rep(FALSE,m1))
delta <- 3
```

We then ran a MC simulation by repeating a procedure in which 10,000 tests were run by using sapply.

``` r
B <- 10
system.time(
  VandS <- replicate(B,{
    calls <- sapply (1:m,function(i){
      control <- sample(population,N)
      treatment <- sample(population,N)
      if(!nullHypothesis[i]) treatment <- treatment + delta
      t.test(treatment,control)$p.val < alpha
    })
    cat("V = ",sum(nullHypothesis & calls), "S=",sum(!nullHypothesis & calls),"\n") 
  })
)
```

    ## V =  421 S= 520 
    ## V =  410 S= 564 
    ## V =  400 S= 552 
    ## V =  366 S= 546 
    ## V =  382 S= 553 
    ## V =  372 S= 505 
    ## V =  382 S= 530 
    ## V =  381 S= 539 
    ## V =  396 S= 554 
    ## V =  380 S= 550

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##  24.249   0.334  27.956

In each iteration, we checked if that iteration was associated with the null or alternative hypothesis. We did this with the line

``` r
#if(!nullHypothesis[i]) treatment <- treatment + delta
```

In R, operations based on matrices are much faster than operations performed within loops or sapply. We can VECTORISE the code to make it go faster. So instead of using sapply to run m tests, we create a matrix with all data in one call to sample.

The following code runs several times faster.

``` r
N <- 12
m <- 10000
library(genefilter) #rowttests is here
set.seed(1)
#Define groups to be used with rowttests
g <- factor(c(rep(0,N),rep(1,N))) #12 0s and 12 1s
B <- 10 #Number of simulations
system.time(
  VandS <- replicate(B,{
    #matrix with control data(rows are tests,columns are mice)
    controls <- matrix(sample(population,N*m,replace=TRUE),nrow=m)
    #matrix with treatment data(rows are tests,columns are mice)
    treatments <- matrix(sample(population,N*m,replace=TRUE),nrow=m)
    
    #add effect to 10% of them
    treatments[which(!nullHypothesis),] <- treatments[which(!nullHypothesis),]+delta
    
    #combine to form one matrix
    dat <- cbind(controls,treatments)
    
    calls <- rowttests(dat,g)$p.value < alpha
    cat("V = ",sum(nullHypothesis & calls), "S=",sum(!nullHypothesis & calls),"\n")
  })
)
```

    ## V =  459 S= 558 
    ## V =  395 S= 577 
    ## V =  466 S= 554 
    ## V =  445 S= 546 
    ## V =  416 S= 515 
    ## V =  413 S= 544 
    ## V =  448 S= 546 
    ## V =  444 S= 551 
    ## V =  440 S= 572 
    ## V =  435 S= 540
