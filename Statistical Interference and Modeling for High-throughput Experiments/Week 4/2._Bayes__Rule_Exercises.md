### Exercise 1

A test for cystic fibrosis has an accuracy of 99%. Specifically, we mean that the probability of a positive test if you have the disease is 0.99 and this is also equal to the probability of testing negative if you don't have the disease:
Prob(+|D) = 0.99, Prob(-|no D) = 0.99
The cystic fibrosis rate in the general population is 1 in 3,900, Prob(D) = 0.00025. If we select a random person and they test positive, what is the probability that they have cystic fibrosis Prob(D|+)?

``` r
accuracy <- 0.99
D <- 0.00025
noD <- 1 - D
probPos <- (accuracy*D) + ((1-accuracy)*noD)
prob <- (accuracy*D)/probPos
prob 
```
