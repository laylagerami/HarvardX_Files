QQ-plot Exercises
================

Load the data into R with the following command:

``` r
load("skew.RData")
```

You should have a 1000 x 9 dimensional matrix 'dat':

``` r
dim(dat)
```

    ## [1] 1000    9

Using QQ-plots, compare the distribution of each column of the matrix to a normal. That is, use qqnorm() on each column. To accomplish this quickly, you can use the following line of code to set up a grid for 3x3=9 plots. ("mfrow" means we want a multifigure grid filled in row-by-row. Another choice is mfcol.)

``` r
par(mfrow = c(3,3))
```

Then you can use a for loop, to loop through the columns, and display one qqnorm() plot at a time.

``` r
for (i in 1:9) {
  qqnorm(dat[,i],main=paste0(i, "th column"))
  qqline(dat[,i])
}
```

Identify the two columns which are skewed. - 9th and 4th.

Examine each of these two columns using a histogram. Note which column has "positive skew", in other words the histogram shows a long tail to the right (toward larger values). Note which column has "negative skew", that is, a long tail to the left (toward smaller values). Note that positive skew looks like an up-shaping curve in a qqnorm() plot, while negative skew looks like a down-shaping curve. 9th has positive skew, 4 has negative skew.

``` r
hist(dat[,4])
```

``` r
hist(dat[,9])
```

``` r
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```
