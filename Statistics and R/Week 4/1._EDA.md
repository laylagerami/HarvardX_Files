Exploratory Data Analysis

### EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a key part of what we do when we analyze data. We start out every analysis with EDA to familiarize ourselves with the data. First, we want to check to see if some of the samples or experiments produce unusable data and take them out of the analysis. We also perform EDA at the end to check for nonsensical results. In fact, one should perform EDA all throughout the analysis. For example, before applying any of the techniques we have learned, we want to make sure the data are in agreement with the necessary assumptions. We will introduce some basic EDA tools such as histogram, the Q-Q plot, scatter plots, boxplot, stratification, log transforms, and several summary statistics.

Biases, systematic errors and unexpected variability are common in data from the life sciences. Failure to discover these problems often leads to flawed analyses and false discoveries. Consider that some experiments fail and not all data processing pipelines (e.g. t.test function) can detect these - yet you still get an snwer. It may be hard or impossible to notice if an error was made just from the reported results.

Graphing data is a powerful approach to detecting these problems. We refer to this as EDA - exploratory data analysis. We use explaratory plots to motivate the analyses we choose.
