Association Tests Exercises
================

In the previous video, Rafa showed how to calculate a Chi-square test from a table. Here we will show how to generate the table from data which is in the form of a dataframe, so that you can then perform an association test to see if two columns have an enrichment (or depletion) of shared occurances.

Download the assoctest.csv file into your R working directory, and then read it into R:

``` r
d = read.csv("assoctest.csv")
```

This dataframe reflects the allele status (either AA/Aa or aa) and the case/control status for 72 individuals.

### Exercise 1

Compute the Chi-square test for the association of genotype with case/control status (using the table() function and the chisq.test() function). Examine the table to see if it look enriched for association by eye. What is the X-squared statistic?

``` r
table(d)
```

    ##       case
    ## allele  0  1
    ##      0 17 17
    ##      1 10 28

``` r
chisq.test(table(d))$statistic
```

    ## X-squared 
    ##  3.343653

### Exercise 2

``` r
fisher.test(table(d))$p.value
```

    ## [1] 0.05193834
