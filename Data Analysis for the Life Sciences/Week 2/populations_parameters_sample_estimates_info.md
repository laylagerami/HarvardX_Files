Populations, parameters and sample estimates info
================

### Information

Imagine there's a population you have never seen before, and you are asked to decide if men are taller than women. You can't see all the population, but you can take some measurements. To add a challenge, for each measurement you are charged a quantity of money (e.g. $1000), and if you get the answer right you get a prize (e.g. $10,000). How many people do you measure to be able to answer the question?
One thing you can do is measure the entire population and get the right answer. But you will be spending a lot of money to take all of the measurements! Statistical inference is therefore a powerful approach that allows you to answer that question by looking at just a few people.

The idea is you take a random sample of people e.g. 10 men, 10 women. And from this smaller group, we will infer the heights of the population. We measure the mean for the male sample and female sample, and work out the difference. Lets say its 3.3 inches. But is that the answer? If we take another sample, this answer will change.

How can we decipher how different this sample mean difference value will be if we take more and more samples? Statistical inference answers this. We want to know how close a sample average is to a population average. This is answered with central limit theorem.
