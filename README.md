# HarvardX_Files
HarvardX files  
Folder for each series and within it, folder for each week. Each video summarised and exercise questions and answers uploaded. R markdown files from data analysis for life sciences, week 2 onwards. Files with LaTeX equations don't show up very well as the equations come up in  code form, but can be viewed (tediously) using an online converter. HTML files will eventually be added.
